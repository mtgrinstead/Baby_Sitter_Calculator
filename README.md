This is a CLI babysitter wage calculator.
It will take in your hours and wages and output the amount to bill for services.

It takes into account that each "Shift" might be charged differently.
The first shift is between Midnight and 0800 in the morning.
Second shift is between 0800 and noon.
Third shift is between noon and 1700 (5:00pm).
Fourth shift is between 1700 (5:00pm) and midnight.

The tool will first ask you what your wage is for each shift.
It will then ask you to input your start and end time. (Seperate them by a space).
If only a start time is entered it will ask again for both the start and end time.

It will then tell you how many hours you worked and the total charge for services.

Press 1 to start over or 0 to quit the tool.
